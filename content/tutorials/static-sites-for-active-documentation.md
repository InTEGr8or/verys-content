## Markdown Uptake

Markdown is the most common document editing language for static websites and it is also being widely adopted by Git repositories, online documentation like MSDN and ReadTheDocs, StackOverflow, etc. You can write PDFs, Word Docs and film scripts in Markdown and use Pandoc to convert them to industry standard formats. You can write complex diagrams with simple descriptive text notation within your Markdown docs, and you can create functional code scripts in static Mardown text files with Notebooks. We're going to create each of these here.
